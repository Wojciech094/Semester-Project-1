                    <h2>Mercury</h2>
                    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, and the nearest to the Sun. <br>
                        <br>
                        Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close
                        to
                        the Sun, day
                        temperatures can reach highs of 800째F (430째C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at
                        night,
                        temperatures can dip
                        as low as -290째F (-180째C).

                        Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system that
                        title
                        belongs to nearby
                        Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun
                        every 88 Earth days.

                    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. <br>
                        <br>
                        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the
                        third
                        brightest object in
                        the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.

                        Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its
                        thick atmosphere traps
                        heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with
                        surface
                        temperatures hot
                        enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed
                        mountains.

                        <br>
                        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our
                        solar
                        system with liquid
                        water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
                        planets closest to the
                        Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

                        Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or
                        Roman
                        mythology. The name
                        was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course,
                        many
                        names for our planet
                        in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.

                    <h2>Mars</h2>
                    <p>Mars the fourth planet from the Sun is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where
                        we've
                        sent rovers to roam
                        the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and
                        warmer,
                        with a thicker
                        atmosphere, billions of years ago.

                        Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of
                        blood. The Egyptians
                        called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."

                        Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt
                        oxidize, or rust, causing
                        the surface to look red.

                        fit
                        inside. <br>
                        <br>
                        Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water,
                        floating in an atmosphere
                        of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the lighter bands are
                        called
                        zones, and they
                        flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm
                        bigger
                        than Earth that has
                        raged for hundreds of years.

                        The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of its
                        moons
                        are also named for
                        mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus.

                        <br>
                        Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
                        Saturn
                        is not the only
                        planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has
                        dozens
                        of moons.

                        From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy

                        the Saturn system

                    <p>The seventh planet from the Sun, Uranus has the third largest diameter of planets in our solar
                        system. <br>
                        <br>
                        Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28
                        small
                        moons. Uranus rotates
                        at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to
                        spin sideways, orbiting
                        the Sun like a rolling ball.

                        Uranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by
                        astronomer William Herschel,
                        although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the
                        object was universally
                        accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.

                        <br>
                        Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from
                        the
                        Sun as Earth.
                        Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune
                        completed its first
                        165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.

                        Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim
                        twilight to
                        us. The warm light
                        we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.
